# tribute
You will need to complete the small freecodecamp exercises as practice to get used to how to write HTML. Once you have them, done, you should start with the Tribute Page using HTML. The tribute page should be done for the next Monday 19th.


Please, create a new repository for that.


Next Wednesday 14th we will resolve doubts and it would be awesome if you can bring the some initial code for the Tribute page, to explain what you've been working on and solve any doubts you may have.

Follow the instructions explained here:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page

The tribute page should contain:
A main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other elements
An element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
A figure or a div element with an id of img-div
Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"
Within the #img-div element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in #img-div
You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab
Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
Your img element should be centered within its parent element
